# [Swift UI](https://getstream.io/tutorials/ios-chat/) AI components for Stream Chat

This official repository for Stream Chat's UI components is designed specifically for AI-first applications written in Swift UI. When paired with our real-time [Chat API](https://getstream.io/chat/), it makes integrating with and rendering responses from LLM providers such as ChatGPT, Gemini, Anthropic or any custom backend easier by providing rich with out-of-the-box components able to render Markdown, Code blocks, tables, thinking indicators, images, etc.

To start, this library includes the following components which assist with this task:
- `StreamingMessageView` - a component that is able to render text, markdown and code in real-time, using character-by-character animation, similar to ChatGPT.
- `AITypingIndicatorView` - a component that can display different states of the LLM (thinking, checking external sources, etc).

Our team plans to keep iterating and adding more components over time. If there's a component you use every day in your apps and would like to see added, please open an issue and we will try to add it üòé.

## Installation

The AI components are available via the Swift Package Manager (SPM). Use the following steps to add the SDK via SPM in Xcode:
- Select "Add Packages‚Ä¶" in File menu
- Paste the URL https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-swift-ai.git
- In the option "Dependency Rule" choose "Up to next major version", and in the text inputs next to it, enter "0.1.0" and "1.0.0" accordingly.

You can also add the components in your package file as a dependency:

```swift
.package(url: "https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-swift-ai.git", from: "0.1.0")
```

The components depend on John Sundell's [Splash](https://github.com/JohnSundell/Splash), as well as Guille Gonzalez's [Swift Markdown UI](https://github.com/gonzalezreal/swift-markdown-ui).

## Usage

### Streaming Message View

The `StreamingMessageView` is a component that can render markdown content efficiently. It has code syntax highlighting, supporting all the major languages. It can render most of the standard markdown content, such as tables, images, etc. 

Under the hood, it implements letter by letter animation, with a character queue, similar to ChatGPT.

Here's an example how to use it.

```swift
StreamingMessageView(
    content: content,
    isGenerating: true
)
```

Additionally, you can specify the speed of the animation, with the `letterInterval` parameter. The default value is 0.005 (5ms).

### AI Typing Indicator View

The `AITypingIndicatorView` is used to present different states of the LLM, such as "Thinking", "Checking External Sources", etc. You can specify any text you need. There's also a nice animation when the indicator is shown.

```swift
AITypingIndicatorView(text: "Thinking")
```

These components are designed to work seamlessly with our existing Swift UI [Chat SDK](https://getstream.io/tutorials/ios-chat/). Our [developer guide](https://getstream.io/chat/solutions/ai-integration/) explains how to get started building AI integrations with Stream and Swift UI.
